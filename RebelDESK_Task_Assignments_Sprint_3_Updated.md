## Updates

- **March 19, 2025**: Natural Language Code Generation feature has been completed ahead of schedule. All related tasks (P2-09, P2-10, P2-11, P2-12, D-09) have been marked as complete. The team will now focus on the remaining tasks for this sprint.
- **March 19, 2025**: Code Editor component has been implemented and integrated with the main window. This includes a powerful code editor with syntax highlighting and line numbers, a file tab component for managing files, and the ability to insert generated code directly into the editor. All related tasks (P3-12, P3-13, P3-14, P3-15, P3-16) have been marked as complete.
- **March 19, 2025**: Improvements have been made to the code editor and file tab components based on the diagnostic report. These improvements include:
  - Enhanced error handling with specific handling for different types of errors and user-friendly error messages
  - More efficient file operations, including atomic file saving, backup creation, and validation of file paths and permissions
  - Improved UI responsiveness through better error handling and validation
  - Language detection for generated code to automatically set the appropriate file extension
  - User-friendly dialogs for inserting generated code into existing files or creating new files
- **March 19, 2025**: Significant progress has been made on the UI Performance Optimization task (P3-08). The following improvements have been implemented:
  - Incremental syntax highlighting for improved performance with large files
  - Lazy loading for UI components to improve startup time and responsiveness
  - UI performance profiler for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks
  - Batch processing of syntax highlighting to avoid blocking the UI thread
  - Time-limited processing to maintain UI responsiveness
  - Comprehensive tests and documentation for the new performance features
- **March 19, 2025**: Fixed issues with the incremental syntax highlighter implementation. The highlighter now properly tracks modified blocks during rehighlighting operations, ensuring that all syntax highlighting is applied correctly. This improves the reliability of the syntax highlighting system while maintaining the performance benefits of incremental highlighting.
