# GitHub Issue: Fix Editor Settings Tests - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
The Editor Settings component had 5 failing tests, which were critical for the functionality of the IDE. These tests were related to syntax highlighting, file modification tracking, and other editor settings.

## Root Causes Identified
After investigation, we identified the following issues:

1. **Syntax Highlighting by Extension**: The language property in the highlighter was not being properly set when opening files with different extensions. This caused the test to fail because both Python and JavaScript files had the same (null) language setting.

2. **File Modification Tracking**: The editor was not properly resetting the unsaved changes flag after saving a file. This caused the test to fail because the editor still showed unsaved changes after saving.

3. **Syntax Theme Configuration**: The syntax theme configuration was not properly initialized in the editor, causing errors when trying to access theme settings.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Syntax Highlighting by Extension
- Modified the `set_language` method in the `SyntaxHighlighter` class to properly handle language names, converting them to lowercase and handling null values.
- Updated the `load_file` method in the `CodeEditor` class to properly set the language property directly on the highlighter object.
- Added language detection in the `_open_file` method of the `MainWindow` class to ensure the language is properly set when opening files from the file browser or menu.

### 2. Fixed File Modification Tracking
- Updated the `save_file` method in the `CodeEditor` class to properly reset both the `unsaved_changes` flag and the document's modified state.
- Modified the `_save_file` method in the `MainWindow` class to directly set the `unsaved_changes` flag on the editor after saving.

### 3. Fixed Syntax Theme Configuration
- Added code to ensure the syntax theme configuration is properly initialized in the `load_file` method of the `CodeEditor` class.
- Added error handling to prevent issues when the syntax theme is not found.

## Test Results
All 5 tests in `src/tests/test_editor_settings.py` now pass successfully:
- `test_editor_initialization`
- `test_font_settings`
- `test_highlight_current_line_setting`
- `test_line_number_area_width`
- `test_line_numbers_setting`

Additionally, 5 out of 6 tests in `src/tests/test_editor_file_manager_integration.py` now pass:
- `test_file_modification_tracking`
- `test_file_reload`
- `test_multiple_file_handling`
- `test_syntax_highlighting_by_extension`
- `test_unsaved_changes_prompt`

The only remaining failing test is `test_file_encoding_handling`, which fails due to a character encoding issue that is not directly related to the editor settings functionality.

## Code Changes
The following files were modified:
- `src/ui/editor/editor.py`
- `src/ui/main_window.py`

## Lessons Learned
1. Proper initialization of configuration settings is crucial for component functionality.
2. Direct property access should be used carefully, especially for objects that might be null or undefined.
3. File encoding handling needs special attention, especially for non-ASCII characters.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the remaining `test_file_encoding_handling` test in the file manager integration tests.
2. Review other components that interact with the editor to ensure they handle settings properly.
3. Consider adding more robust error handling for file operations with different encodings.
