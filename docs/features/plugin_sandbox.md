# Plugin Sandbox System

RebelDESK includes a robust plugin sandbox system that enhances security by restricting plugin access to system resources and isolating plugins from each other and the main application. This guide explains how the plugin sandbox system works and how it protects your system.

## Overview

The plugin sandbox system provides the following security features:

- **Permission-based access control**: Plugins must request specific permissions to access system resources.
- **Resource limits**: Plugins are limited in the amount of system resources they can use.
- **Module restrictions**: Plugins can only import modules that are explicitly allowed.
- **Isolation**: Plugins are isolated from each other and the main application.
- **Secure loading and execution**: Plugins are loaded and executed in a controlled environment.

## How It Works

### Permission-Based Access Control

Plugins must request specific permissions to access system resources. When you install a plugin, you'll see a list of permissions that the plugin is requesting. You can choose to grant or deny these permissions based on your trust in the plugin and its requirements.

The following permissions are available:

- **File Read**: Allows the plugin to read files from your file system.
- **File Write**: Allows the plugin to write files to your file system.
- **Network**: Allows the plugin to access the network.
- **Process**: Allows the plugin to start or interact with system processes.
- **UI**: Allows the plugin to create or modify UI elements.
- **System**: Allows the plugin to access system information and resources.
- **Plugin**: Allows the plugin to interact with other plugins.

### Resource Limits

Plugins are limited in the amount of system resources they can use. This prevents plugins from consuming too many resources and affecting the performance of RebelDESK or your system. The following resource limits are enforced:

- **Memory**: Plugins are limited in the amount of memory they can use.
- **CPU Time**: Plugins are limited in the amount of CPU time they can use.
- **File Handles**: Plugins are limited in the number of files they can have open at once.
- **Network Connections**: Plugins are limited in the number of network connections they can have open at once.

### Module Restrictions

Plugins can only import modules that are explicitly allowed. This prevents plugins from importing modules that could be used to bypass security restrictions or access sensitive information. By default, plugins can only import a limited set of safe modules.

### Isolation

Plugins are isolated from each other and the main application. This prevents plugins from interfering with each other or with RebelDESK itself. Each plugin runs in its own sandbox, with its own set of permissions, resource limits, and allowed modules.

### Secure Loading and Execution

Plugins are loaded and executed in a controlled environment. This prevents plugins from executing malicious code during the loading process. The plugin sandbox system carefully controls how plugins are loaded and executed to ensure that they cannot bypass security restrictions.

## Managing Plugin Permissions

You can manage plugin permissions through the Plugin Manager in RebelDESK. To access the Plugin Manager:

1. Open RebelDESK
2. Go to **Tools > Plugins > Manage Plugins**
3. Select a plugin from the list
4. Click the **Permissions** tab

From here, you can view and modify the permissions granted to the plugin. You can also view the resource limits and allowed modules for the plugin.

## Installing Plugins

When you install a plugin, you'll see a list of permissions that the plugin is requesting. You should carefully review these permissions before installing the plugin. If a plugin is requesting permissions that seem unnecessary for its functionality, you may want to reconsider installing it.

To install a plugin:

1. Open RebelDESK
2. Go to **Tools > Plugins > Install Plugin**
3. Select the plugin file
4. Review the requested permissions
5. Click **Install** to install the plugin with the requested permissions, or **Cancel** to abort the installation

## Troubleshooting

If a plugin is not working correctly, it may be because it doesn't have the permissions it needs. You can try granting additional permissions to the plugin through the Plugin Manager.

If a plugin is causing performance issues, it may be exceeding its resource limits. You can try increasing the resource limits for the plugin through the Plugin Manager.

If a plugin is still not working correctly after adjusting permissions and resource limits, you may need to contact the plugin developer for assistance.

## Security Recommendations

To maintain a secure environment when using plugins:

1. **Only install plugins from trusted sources**: Be cautious about installing plugins from unknown or untrusted sources.

2. **Review permissions carefully**: Before installing a plugin, carefully review the permissions it is requesting. If a plugin is requesting permissions that seem unnecessary for its functionality, you may want to reconsider installing it.

3. **Use the principle of least privilege**: Only grant plugins the permissions they need to function. Avoid granting unnecessary permissions, especially powerful ones like Process or System.

4. **Keep plugins updated**: Keep your plugins updated to ensure that you have the latest security fixes.

5. **Monitor plugin behavior**: Pay attention to how plugins behave. If a plugin is behaving suspiciously, you may want to disable or uninstall it.

6. **Regularly audit plugins**: Regularly review the plugins you have installed and the permissions they have been granted. Remove any plugins that you no longer need or trust.

## For Plugin Developers

If you're developing a plugin for RebelDESK, you should be aware of the plugin sandbox system and how it affects your plugin. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Request only the permissions you need**: Your plugin should only request the permissions it needs to function. Requesting unnecessary permissions may cause users to be suspicious of your plugin.

2. **Handle permission denials gracefully**: Your plugin should handle cases where it doesn't have the permissions it needs. Provide clear error messages to users when your plugin can't perform an action due to missing permissions.

3. **Be mindful of resource usage**: Your plugin should be efficient with its resource usage. Avoid consuming too much memory, CPU time, or other resources.

4. **Document your plugin's requirements**: Clearly document the permissions and resources your plugin needs. This helps users understand why your plugin is requesting certain permissions.

5. **Test your plugin in a sandboxed environment**: Test your plugin in a sandboxed environment to ensure that it works correctly with the permissions and resource limits it will have in a real environment.

## Conclusion

The plugin sandbox system is an important security feature of RebelDESK. It helps protect your system from malicious or poorly written plugins by restricting what plugins can do and the resources they can use. By understanding how the plugin sandbox system works, you can make informed decisions about which plugins to install and what permissions to grant them.
