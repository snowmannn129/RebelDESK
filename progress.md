## **Recent Updates**
- Created project structure with modular organization
- Implemented basic configuration management system
- Set up main window UI skeleton
- Implemented code editor with syntax highlighting and line numbering
- Integrated editor with main window for file operations
- Added comprehensive unit tests for the editor component
- Implemented file operations (open, save, save as)
- Added syntax highlighting with support for multiple languages
- Implemented auto-indentation and line numbering
- Created settings panel with tabbed interface for customization
- Implemented theme, font, editor, keyboard shortcuts, and plugin settings
- Added unit tests for settings panel and integration with main window
- Implemented AI code completion with Jedi and Transformer models
- Added context-aware code suggestions based on current code
- Created language-specific code completions
- Implemented LLM abstraction layer for AI code assistance

- Add advanced settings features (search, conflict detection, etc.)

**üìù Notes:**  
- All UI components must be connected to backend functions before marking as complete
- Testing is required for all features before approval
